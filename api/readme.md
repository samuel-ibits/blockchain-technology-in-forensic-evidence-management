# Encrypted File Sharing Project

This project demonstrates a simplified example of encrypted file storage and sharing using Ethereum smart contracts and a Node.js backend. Users can upload encrypted files, interact with the smart contract, and share encrypted files via email.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/encrypted-file-sharing.git
   cd encrypted-file-sharing
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Ethereum Configuration:**

   - Obtain an Ethereum wallet address and private key for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Replace `'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'` in `app.js` with your Ethereum private key.
   - Replace `'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'` with the deployed address of your smart contract.
   - Replace `'YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI'` with the ABI of your smart contract.

4. **Email Configuration:**

   - Set up a nodemailer transporter with your email service provider credentials in `app.js`.
   - Replace `'YOUR_EMAIL_SERVICE'`, `'YOUR_EMAIL'`, and `'YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD'`.

5. **Running the Node.js Backend:**

   Start the Node.js backend server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The backend will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

6. **Smart Contract:**

   - Write and deploy a smart contract that handles encrypted file storage on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Update the contract ABI and address in the Node.js backend.

## Usage

1. **Upload Encrypted File:**

   - Use the `/upload` endpoint to upload an encrypted file to the backend.
   - The encrypted data will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain using your smart contract.

2. **Share Encrypted File:**

   - Use the `/send-email` endpoint to share an encrypted file via email.
   - Provide the recipient's email address and the encrypted data.
   - The recipient will receive an email with the encrypted file attached.

3. **Decryption:**

   - Implement decryption logic in the backend as needed based on your encryption method.
   - Use the `/decrypt` endpoint to decrypt the encrypted data, and implement the logic to share the decrypted data securely.

## Notes

- This example provides a starting point and should be extended with proper security measures and error handling for a production environment.
- Never expose sensitive information like private keys and passwords in your code or repositories.
